## Key Changes

### Removed
- Cloudflare Workers Durable Objects (`browser-durable-object.ts`)
- Cloudflare Workers-specific bindings and APIs
- @vercel/og and React dependencies (replaced with Canvas API)
- Template JSX component approach

### Added
- Node.js server with Hono
- Canvas-based image processing
- Queue management system for handling concurrent requests
- Improved logging and error handling
- Session tracking and timeouts
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Implementation Details

1. **Server Setup**
   - Implemented Node.js HTTP server using Hono and @hono/node-server
   - Added environment variable loading with dotenv

2. **Screenshot Service**
   - Migrated from Cloudflare Puppeteer to Playwright with Browserbase
   - Implemented robust error handling and timeout mechanisms
   - Added detailed logging throughout the screenshot process

3. **Image Processing**

   - Maintained the same visual styling with base image, screenshot, and overlay

4. **Queue Management**
